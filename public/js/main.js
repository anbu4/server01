Many apes societies have grown from when the Moses-like Caesar brought his people to an oasis, while humans have been reduced to a feral-like existence.

In this setting, one ape leader begins to enslave other groups to find human technology, while another ape, who watched his clan be taken, embarks on a journey to find freedom. A young human woman becomes key to the latters quest, although she has plans of her own."

All this is not about our protagonist Sid, because he has always admired people from behind the scenes, those who almost do not take any action in the open, but appear only at the most crucial moment and, having done the job, disappears without a trace. In our world, it is difficult to pull off such a thing, because no matter what you do, you can't go against the atomic bomb. And so, thinking about ways to repel nuclear weapons with his bare hands, our hero comes to the conclusion that there is no way without magic. Conveniently it turned out, because soon after that the guy met the notorious truck, which sent him to the other world, or to be more precise, to the world full of swords, magic and other delights of fantasy universes. Now Sid will have no obstacles on his way to becoming the greatest ruler from the shadows. Translated with DeepL.com (free version)",

Everyone entered reality, dissolved into it and gathered in the City. The creator appeared. A huge black shadow explained to the participants that it was possible to return to the real world only by going through the whole game. But there is one cruel moment, virtual death means death in real life and it is impossible to pass it at random. After the loud words the creator vaporized, leaving the players alone.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to the message was different. Desperation set in, some teamed up with others, and some, like Kazuto's character, went it alone. Kirigaya is an orphan and so once in this world, he loses nothing. He is a beta tester and knowing everything about the game, he quickly gained popularity with the players. The hero realizes that without interaction with others he can not get out and has to establish contacts with other players. And while the swordfight is going on, everyone will see a lot of amazing things.",
